# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Regressor-Model-for-Predicting-the-Salary-of-the-Employee

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Regressor Model for Predicting the Salary of the Employee.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
### step 1
Import pandas as pd and import the required dataset.
### step 2
Calculate the null values in the dataset.
### step 3
Import the LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing
### step 4
Convert the string values to numeric values.
### step 5
Import train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
### step 6
Assign the train and test dataset.
### step 7
Import DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree.
### step 8
Import metrics from sklearn.metrics.
### step 9
Calculate the MeanSquareError.
### step 10
Apply the metrics to the dataset.
### step 11
Predict the output for the required values.
